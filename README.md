# Foodies - Modern Android Architecture

Foodies is a sample project that presents a modern approach to Android app development.

The project tries to combine popular Android tools and to demonstrate best development practices by utilizing up to date tech-stack like Compose, Kotlin Flow and Hilt.

The sample app presents a modern Android application Architecture that is scalable and maintainable through a MVVM blend with MVI. Additionally, the application features animations like expanding and collapsing row items or other effects like collapsing toolbar.

## Architecture
The project is layered traditionally with a View, Presentation, Model separation and presents a blend between MVVM and MVI inspired from [Yusuf Ceylan's architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/mvi-architecture-with-kotlin-flows-and-channels-d36820b2028d) but adapted to Compose.

Architecture layers:
* View - Composable screens that consume state, apply effects and delegate events.
* ViewModel - [AAC ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that manages and reduces the state of the corresponding screen. Additionally, it intercepts UI events and produces side-effects. The ViewModel lifecycle scope is tied to the corresponding screen composable.
* Model - Repository classes that retrieve data. In a clean architecture context, one should use use-cases that tap into repositories.

As the architecture blends MVVM with MVI, there are a three core components described:
* **State** - data class that holds the state content of the corresponding screen e.g. list of `FoodItem`, loading status etc. The state is exposed as a Compose runtime `MutableState` object from that perfectly matches the use-case of receiving continuous updates with initial value.

* **Event** - plain object that is sent through callbacks from the UI to the presentation layer. Events should reflect UI events caused by the user. Event updates are exposed as a `MutableSharedFlow` type which is similar to `StateFlow` and that behaves as in the absence of a subscriber, any posted event will be immediately dropped.

* **Effect** - plain object that signals one-time side-effect actions that should impact the UI e.g. triggering a navigation action, showing a Toast, SnackBar etc. Effects are exposed as `ChannelFlow` which behave as in each event is delivered to a single subscriber. An attempt to post an event without subscribers will suspend as soon as the channel buffer becomes full, waiting for a subscriber to appear.

Every screen/flow defines its own contract class that states all corresponding core components described above: state content, events and effects.

### Dependency injection
[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) is used for Dependency Injection as a wrapper on top of [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger). 

Most of the dependencies are injected with `@Singleton` scope and are provided within the `FoodMenuApiProvider` module.

For ViewModels, we use the out-of-the-box `@HiltViewModel` annotation that injects them with the scope of the navigation graph composables that represent the screens.

### Decoupling Compose
Since Compose is a standalone declarative UI framework, one must try to decouple it from the Android framework as much as possible. In order to achieve this, the project uses an `EntryPointActivity` that defines a navigation graph where every screen is a composable.

The `EntryPointActivity` also collects `state` objects and passes them together with the `Effect` flows to each Screen composable. This way, the Activity is coupled with the navigation component and only screen (root level) composables. This causes the screen composables to only receive and interact with plain objects and Kotlin flows, therefore being platform agnostic.
